<!-- What are closures? Give an example of closures -->
It is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
ex :- function OuterFunction() {

    var outerVariable = 100;
  
    function InnerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable);
    }
  
    return InnerFunction;
  }
   var innerFunc=OuterFunction();
   innerFunc();

<!-- Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind() -->
call() - It invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments one by one.
ex - const person = {
    firstName:"John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    fullName: function () {
      return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
  }
  
  person.fullName();  
  
apply() - It invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.
ex - const person = {
    fullName: function() {
      return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
  }
  
  const person1 = {
    firstName: "Mary",
    lastName: "Doe"
  }
  person.fullName.apply(person1);



bind() - I t returns a new function, allowing you to pass in a this array and any number of arguments.
ex - const person = {
    firstName:"John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    fullName: function () {
      return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
  }
  const member = {
    firstName:"Hege",
    lastName: "Nilsen",
  }
  let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);

<!-- What is creation phase and execution phase? -->
Creation Phase:- All the variables are allocated memories and assigned with a default value as undefined.
They are not initalization with their initial values.
Execution Phase:- We allocate the actual values to the variables instead of the default value.

<!-- What are objects in javascript? -->
Object is a non-primitive data-type that allows you to store multiple collections of data.

<!-- What are function constructors? -->
A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. 
It is a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword. 
The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object
 properties.
ex - const sum = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');
console.log(sum(2, 6));

<!-- Explain prototypes -->
The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default.
ex - const parentObject={

name:"ritika",
age:23,


}
var childObect=Object.create(parentObject)
console.log(parentObject.name);
console.log(childObect.name);


<!-- What is prototype chain -->
In prototype chain each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype.
That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype.

<!-- Give an example of inheritance using function constructor -->
Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability. In the above example, 
the Student class inherits all the methods and properties of the Person class. 
Hence, the Student class will now have the name property and the greet() method.

<!-- What are callbacks? -->
A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function.
ex- function greeting(name) {
  alert('Hello ' + name);
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
  var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);

<!-- What is the use of setTimeout -->
It sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.
Syntax: setTimeout(function, time);

<!-- What is an event loop and call stack -->
Event loop - It is responsible for exceuting the code, collecting and processing events, and 
exceuting queued sub - tasks.
Call stack - It is a mechanism for interpreter to keep track of multiple function call.
